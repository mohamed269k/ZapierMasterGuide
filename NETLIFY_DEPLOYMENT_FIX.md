# Netlify Deployment Fix

## Problem
When deployed to Netlify, the automations aren't loading because the backend API is not available, but the frontend is trying to load data from the server.

## Solution
I've implemented a hybrid approach that:
1. Tries to load from the API first (works locally)
2. Falls back to a static JSON file (works on Netlify)
3. Creates an empty array as final fallback

## Files Modified

### 1. `/client/public/data/automations.json`
- Created static JSON file with all 30 automations
- Contains complete automation data for static deployments

### 2. `/client/src/lib/api.ts`
- New utility for loading automations with fallback mechanism
- Detects deployment environment and chooses appropriate data source

### 3. `/client/src/pages/home.tsx`
- Updated to use the new API utility instead of direct API calls

### 4. `/netlify.toml`
- Updated build command to copy static files properly
- Ensures the JSON file is available in the built site

## For Netlify Deployment

1. **Build Command**: `vite build && cp -r client/public/* dist/public/`
2. **Publish Directory**: `dist/public`
3. **The site will automatically load the static JSON file when the API is not available**

## Testing

The fix has been tested locally and should work for:
- Local development (uses API)
- Netlify static deployment (uses JSON file)
- Any other static hosting (uses JSON file)

## Manual Fix if Needed

If the automations are still not loading on Netlify, manually ensure:

1. The `/data/automations.json` file exists in your deployed site
2. You can access it at `https://your-site.netlify.app/data/automations.json`
3. The browser console doesn't show any 404 errors

## Alternative: Force Static Mode

If you want to force static mode for testing, you can temporarily modify the API to always use the static file by commenting out the API attempt in `/client/src/lib/api.ts`.
